NIP-85
======

Reviews
-------

This NIP describes several different types of `review` which follow a single set of conventions.

In all cases, the `content` field SHOULD include a human-readable review. A single [NIP 73](./73.md) `i` tag indicates the object of the review. This allows for reviews of events, people, topics, relays, or external guids.

# Ratings

Tags MAY contain additional `rating` tags each of which should have a `value` between 0 and 1,
and an optional `mark` specifying an attribute of the thing being reviewed.

# Review Kinds

## Relays

Kind `1987` indicates a review of a relay:

```json
{
  "kind": 1987,
  "content": "This relay is fast!",
  "tags": [
    ["rating", "0.8"],
    ["rating", "0.2", "content"],
    ["rating", "1", "speed"],
    ["i", "wss://relay.example.com/"]
  ],
}
```
