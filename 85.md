Reviews
-------

`draft` `optional` `author:staab`

Kind `1986` MAY be used to leave a review with optional ratings.

The `content` field SHOULD include a human-readable review.

The review event MUST include one or more `e`, `a`, `p`, `t`, or `r` tags indicating
the object of the review. This allows for reviews of events, people, topics, and relays
or external resources. As with NIP-01, a relay hint SHOULD be included when using `e` and
`p` tags.

Tags MAY contain additional `rating` tags each of which should have a `value` between 0 and 1,
and an optional `mark` specifying an attribute of the thing being reviewed.

Examples
--------

  "tags": [

    ["rating", "0.2", "smell"],
    ["rating", "1", "service"],
