NIP-85

Reviews
-------

This NIP describes several different types of `review` which follow a single set of conventions.

In all cases, the `content` field SHOULD include a human-readable review.

Review events' `d` tag indicates the object of the review. This MUST take the form of a [NIP 73](./73.md) id. This allows for reviews of events, people, topics, relays, or external guids without ambiguity.

# Ratings

Tags MAY contain additional `rating` tags each of which should have a `value` between 0 and 1,
and an optional `mark` specifying an attribute of the thing being reviewed.

# Review Kinds

## Relays

Kind `31987` indicates a review of a relay. The `d` tag MUST be the url of the relay.

```json
{
  "kind": 31987,
  "content": "This relay is fast!",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "wss://relay.example.com/"],
    ["rating", "0.8"],
    ["rating", "0.2", "content"],
    ["rating", "1", "speed"]
  ],
}
```
